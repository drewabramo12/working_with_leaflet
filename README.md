# working_with_leaflet

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to show the capabilities of leaflet to enact map layers. These layers have a wide versatility of origins and are quite flexible in what they can depict.

## Results

I was able to add two extra map layers that showed tectonic plates and higher magnitude earthquakes as well. This data was also depicted in correspondence with a wide range of features from circle marker size to color. Both of these were connected to earthquake magnitudes as well.

## Summary

This project shows that leaflet has a wide potential for usage in depicting geopositional data and can also work well with diverse JSON file locations. One thing that I might due to improve this project further is find a way to allow for live updating to show what earthquakes are currently happening.
